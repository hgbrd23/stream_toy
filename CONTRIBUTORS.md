# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## Purpose

By contributing to StreamToy, you agree to the terms below. This agreement protects both you and the project maintainer while allowing the project to evolve over time.

## Your Grant of Rights

By submitting a contribution to this project (via pull request, patch, or any other means), you agree to the following:

### 1. License Grant to Your Contributions

You grant the project maintainer (Stefan Koch, streamtoy@sckoch.eu) and all users of StreamToy:

- A **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license** to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and create derivative works from your contributions
- The right to sublicense these rights to others
- The right to use your contributions under the current project license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) **or any future license** the maintainer chooses

### 2. Patent Grant

If your contributions include any patents, you grant a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, use, sell, and distribute your contributions as part of this project.

### 3. Right to Relicense

You acknowledge and agree that the project maintainer retains the right to:

- Change the project license in the future
- Offer the project under multiple licenses simultaneously (dual-licensing)
- Offer commercial licenses to third parties
- Make exceptions to the license terms for specific use cases

This flexibility ensures the project can adapt to changing needs, form partnerships, and potentially offer commercial support while keeping a free version available.

### 4. Your Representations

By contributing, you represent that:

- You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses
- Your contribution is your original creation, or you have sufficient rights to submit it
- Your contribution does not violate any third-party rights
- You are not aware of any claims or suits related to your contribution

### 5. No Obligation to Use

The project maintainer is under no obligation to:
- Accept or include your contribution
- Maintain your contribution in future versions
- Provide support for your contribution

### 6. Attribution

You agree that your contributions may be attributed to you in the project documentation, commit history, and release notes. If you prefer anonymity, please indicate this when submitting.

## Why This Agreement?

This CLA serves several important purposes:

1. **Legal Clarity**: Ensures everyone understands the rights being granted
2. **Future Licensing Options**: Allows the project to evolve (e.g., move to GPL, offer commercial versions)
3. **Protection**: Protects both contributors and users from legal issues
4. **Sustainability**: Enables potential commercial partnerships that can fund development while keeping a free version
